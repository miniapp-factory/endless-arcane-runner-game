+Code the following app

+an endless arcade runner game using HTML5 Canvas. The player controls a glowing neon cube that runs automatically. Instead of jumping, clicking or tapping the screen instantly reverses gravity, flipping the cube from the floor to the ceiling and vice versa. Procedurally generate obstacles like spikes or blocks on both the top and bottom surfaces that the player must avoid. The game speed should gradually increase the longer the player survives. Use a dark background with bright cyberpunk neon colors for the player and obstacles. Display the current score in the corner and show a Game Over screen with a restart button upon collision.

+resize the game canvas to a fixed dimension of 800 pixels wide by 400 pixels high to give it a compact arcade feel. Center this canvas in the middle of the browser window with a dark page background. Ensure the gravity logic and obstacle generation adapt correctly to this new smaller height so gameplay remains balanced.

+add a thick, glowing neon border around the canvas to clearly define the game boundaries. Significantly reduce the initial game speed to make the gameplay more accessible and less frantic at the start. To balance the slower speed, increase the frequency and density of the obstacles, ensuring there are enough hazards to dodge without making it impossible.
